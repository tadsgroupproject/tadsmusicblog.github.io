            <h1>WELCOME TO MY WEBSITE</h1>
            <p>This website is for my opinions on music and music related things, the main type of content you will see on my website is album reviews and possibly single reviews one day. I'll go into a little detail about my favorite bands and artists. My current favorite artist is Frank Zappa. Other bands/artists that I like include Weezer, Swans, Radiohead, Merzbow, Kendrick Lamar, Tyler The Creator, MF DOOM, Neutral Milk Hotel, Death Grips, King Crimson, Sonic Youth, Built To Spill, John Coltrane, Fishmans, and many many more. I don't really have any favorite genres but I typically stay away from country, maybe soon I'll find some country I enjoy. I'm constantly trying to open up to new musical experiences so if you have any recommendations you can contact me on discord (Tadical#1347). </p>

                <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
                <p>My name is Tad and two of my favorite things are music and technology. They have both been an incredibly important part of my life ever since I was young. I grew up mainly on Christian music until I was around 6 which is when I started to discover my own taste in music; at the time this mainly consisted of minecraft parodies since I was like 6 years old. The first band I really got into was The Beatles which I was introduced to by my Papa, I was around 8 or 9 when I first started listening to them and they left a lasting impression on my taste in music although I don't listen to them all that much anymore. For several years I considered the beatles to be my favorite band until about 8th grade when I discovered Death Grips. I was recommended Death Grips by a friend who I don't talk to anymore. The first thing I thought when I heard my first Death Grips song was "wow this sucks," after about one week of listening to Death Grips off and on I realized that I loved it. The style of Death Grips was something I had never previously heard of before, Experimental Hip Hop wasn't even a word in my vocabulary. Death Grips helped me get through a really rough time in 2019 which is another reason I love them so much. Later on in life I got heavily into Modest Mouse and Weezer which yet again helped shaped my taste in music. Also currently I play the Clarinet in high school marching band.</p>
                <br><br>
                <p>Technology has shaped my world ever since I was little. I grew up on the Wii and Ds Lite, the Wii is still one of my favorite consoles of all time; I have so many fond memories of playing games on the Wii with family and friends. I had an Xbox 360 at one point which I stupidly traded the Wii for, I mainly just used it to play Minecraft and Call Of Duty. Currently I own a Nintendo Switch and a Retron 2 which is a system that has two slots for Snes and Nes games. My favorite game on the Snes is A Link To The Past although I don't own it physically. Overall I'm a pretty big nerd when it comes to technology, I hope to go to college one day for either Computer Science or Music.</p>
