                <h1>1/10</h1>
                <p>Summer In Paradise is the 27th studio album released by the band The Beach Boys in 1992. This album is the only Beach Boys album to not feature new Brian Wilson contributions and was produced by Terry Melcher. Summer In Paradise is considered to be the worst Beach Boys album and failed to chart in both the UK and US. It was such a commercial failure that the Beach Boys didn't release another album until 2012 with "That's Why God Made The Radio." Most of the instruments on this album are made with a Macintosh Quadra computer with all of the rhythm and drums being electronic and sounding cheap. The lyrics on this album don't have much meaning to them and feel bland and unoriginal, they are generally about surfing and things associated with summer and feel rushed as well as not being fully thought out. There is even rapping on this album that is done very poorly at best but it is the funniest part of the whole album. It is easy to understand the negative reviews on this album, Nothing feels connected or carefully planned and most songs on here feel like filler. In contrast to their most popular and well-received album "Pet Sounds," The production on this album feels sloppy and disconnected; Some parts made me feel uneasy with how disconnected it was compared to Pet Sounds. I believe this to be possibly the worst album ever made or at least one of them. Nothing feels like it belongs and you can tell there wasn't love or care put into this album. It would probably be higher rated if it was humorously bad but I believe that this was intended to be taken seriously which makes me sad. It's okay if you enjoyed this album, but many will not. </p>
